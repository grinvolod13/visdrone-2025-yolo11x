# Object detection with Yolo11 on VisDrone dataset

## üîé Overview and Results
We trained Yolo11x model for  [KAU Object Detection: VisDrone 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kau-object-detection-vis-drone-2025) competition

‚≠êWe got **0.17255** private and **0.17867** public score for the last our model

‚≠ê We got  **mAP50=0.461**  and  **mAP50-95 = 0.267** on validation dataset

## üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training
We fine-tuned Yolo11x model for 100 epohs, with the next parameters:
* *batch size* - **24**
* *optimizer* - **Adam**
* *learning rate* - **0.001**
* *image size* - **640**

For training, we used **2x Tesla T4** GPU on Kaggle

Additionally, we tried various combinations of training, such as folowing, but they got bad results:
 - 80 epochs of lr=0.01 and 40 epochs of lr0=0.001 & lrf=0.0001
 - 80 epochs of lr=0.01 and 80 epochs of lr0=0.001 & lrf=0.0001
 - 100 epochs of lr=0.001 and 10 epochs of lr0=0.0005 & lrf=0.00001
 - 80 epochs of lr=0.01 and up to 120 epochs of lr<0.01 (check out other Kaggle notebook's versions run's logs)


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Install & run 
Training was performed in [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/volodymyrhryniuk/kau-visdrone-2025-yolov11x-training/) with **2x Tesla T4** GPU

All notebooks are intended to run in Kaggle environment, so if you want to launch them elsewere, please, change all paths to appropriate, and install all needed CUDA libraries
